## Inspiration
What inspired us, since we are avid basketball fans we decided on take on this challenge.
## What it does
Some exploratory analysis on the statistics for each team and player. It displays a comparison, ordered in a decreasing many based on features decided by the user from a drop down menu. More technical is our quantitative ranking at the bottom. It shows multiple graphs based on team or player, determining who ranks the highest/lowest in the respective basketball category.

## How I built it
Initially, we used PandaSQL to query, clean, and aggregate the data. A jupyter notebook was used to perform the analysis and preview the display of our charts and plots. Following that, we used Dash by Plotly, along with HTML/CSS to design the dashboard to our liking.

## Challenges I ran into
As non-cs majors, we found it new and challenging to develop a web application. We have all worked with Python but HTML/CSS were opportunities for us to explore and integrate into our development.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We have something running and usable to interact with. The design is very simple. We collaborated well and contributed a significant part in our own respects to create our first presentable app.

## What I learned
The backbone of web applications, we learned that having knowledge about CSS and HTML is rather important because it allows to consider better looking designs and add a personal touch to our product.

## What's next for NBA2kDash
As for deployment, we have confidence that our app can assist interested gamers wanting to find out more about 2k and the performance of the current players/teams. With more data on a game-by-game basis, we can analyse more deeply the dynamic makeup of the game, find flaws, and suggest changes or recommendations to the lineup.
